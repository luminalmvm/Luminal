# Test-feedback log — 2026-07 pass 2

Working tracker (not a spec). Owner feedback captured verbatim-in-intent, with stable
IDs so nothing is lost and progress can be ticked off. When an item lands, tick it and
note the commit. Decision-sized items are logged in `docs/02-DECISIONS.md`; effect
changes update `docs/08` and ship their oracle test; new concepts update `GUIDE.md`.

## Reusable primitives (build first — several items depend on these)

- [x] **P1 — Matte/depth-input combobox.** (done, K-142) None / Masks / Effects and masks on
  track matte + DoF depth; old bool migrated (true→Effects and masks, false→None). Owner follow-up: default is now
  **Effects and masks**; old `true`→Effects and masks, `false`→Masks (faithful, no mask loss).
- [x] **P2 — Channel-colour picker.** (done, K-143) reusable `channel_picker` widget keyed by
  `channel_colour_1/2/3` ids; chromatic aberration is the first adopter.
- [x] **P3 — Edges mode enum.** (done, K-145) Transparent / Repeat / Mirror, reusable wherever edges
  can become visible (radial blur already has it; shake, etc.). (from FX-11)
- [x] **P4 — Collapsible "twirl" sub-section.** (done, K-145) A disclosure group inside an effect's
  params to hide controls the user does not always need. First user: shake's z / extra
  axes. Reusable across effects. (from FX-11)
- [x] **P5 — Value-range policy (K-decision).** (done, K-135) Unless a property name contains `%` or a
  0–1 ratio is genuinely the natural unit (e.g. vignette roundness), prefer pixel / real
  units with `0..inf` (or wider signed) ranges rather than 0–1. Audit existing effects and
  widen where it helps. (from FX-6)

## UI

- [ ] **UI-1** Linked-property value boxes still clipped — specific to properties with the
  link control (anchor, position, scale). The link icon steals width.
- [x] **UI-2** Clicking an effect property's *name* in the layer area should highlight the
  layer; currently doesn't. — done: effect-row click now sets `selected_layer` in both the
  Timeline layer area and the docked effects panel.
- [ ] **UI-3** Project tab: search bar across the top of the whole panel (files/layers).
- [ ] **UI-4** Project panel selected-layer info box: give it fixed padding so switching
  layers doesn't shift the info placement; clicking footage shows a small thumbnail
  preview *in that box*, not in the viewfinder.
- [x] **UI-5** Lane keyframe selection: Shift and Ctrl both toggle now — click gesture and the
  drag-marquee (a Shift/Ctrl box deselects covered keys instead of only adding).
- [ ] **UI-6** Layer area: selecting a property *name* (Transform, an effect, …) should
  support multi-select, so a user can key several at the same point at once.
- [x] **UI-7** Copy/paste keyframes fixed: egui-winit emits Copy/Paste events (not Key C/V), so the old shortcut watch never fired; now reads the events. (Nuance: needs non-empty OS clipboard, which self-heals on first copy.)
- [ ] **UI-8** Graph view scroll also scrolls the layer area, and the scrollbar sits in the
  graph view. Move the scrollbar back to the right of the layer area so both scroll
  independently. (Layer view scroll is already correct.)
- [x] **UI-9** Dropper cursor now shows whenever the tool is armed (painted on a foreground
  layer at the pointer, OS cursor hidden), not just over the image; magnifier stays
  viewfinder-only. (Please eyeball the cursor across panels.)
- [ ] **UI-10** "Save stack as preset" should save only the effects/keyframes the user has
  highlighted: all non-keyframed values as set, plus exactly the selected keyframes from
  the selected effects — nothing unselected.
- [ ] **UI-11** Flow input rate: make it a textbox the user types into (not a dropdown),
  and keyframeable like any other property.
- [x] **UI-12** Per-layer motion-blur toggle now drawn: it was only ever in the right-click
  menu, never the switch row. Shows as an "MB" text switch (no motion-blur glyph exists) in the
  far-right slot; flips `switches.motion_blur`.
- [x] **UI-13** Importing footage should auto-highlight it in the Project tab and switch to
  that tab if not already there. — done: import selects the new item and raises the Project
  tab (`focus_project_tab` flag consumed by the shell).
- [ ] **UI-14** Bottom timeline bar: the graph-option buttons are slightly clipped — make
  room.
- [ ] **UI-15** Viewfinder: in soft mode the zoomed preview spills over the border edges —
  it must sit behind the border. In round mode the bottom bar should be a pill spanning the
  bottom.

## Effects

- [x] **FX-1** Posterize time fixed: the decode planner still chose the frame-time source, so
  footage-only motion never stepped; now `posterize_sample_times` snaps the decode/sample time
  per scope (this-layer vs everything-below). Preview == export.
- [x] **FX-2** Split Blur into three effects — **Gaussian** (Radius), **Directional**
  (Length, Angle), **Radial** (Amount, Centre X/Y, Type = Spin/Zoom, Edges). Directional
  length and radial amount should exceed 100. — done (K-137): three separate effects; old
  "blur" loads as Gaussian; Length/Amount hard-unbounded above; Edges kept on Radial.
- [x] **FX-3** Sharpen is an unsharp filter — rename it **Unsharp Mask**, and add a plain
  **Sharpen** (amount). — done (K-138): existing effect relabelled "Unsharp mask"; new
  "Sharpen" is a 3×3 high-pass with an Amount dial + oracle test.
- [x] **FX-4** Matte/depth after-effects → **None / Masks / Effects and masks** combobox (K-142),
  bool removed. Real sites were the track matte + DoF depth (the "Matte key" effect has no layer input).
- [x] **FX-5** Saturation should exceed 200. — done (K-135): hard cap lifted, slider to 400 %.
- [x] **FX-6** Vignette softness now `0..inf` (K-135), roundness stays 0–1.
- [x] **FX-7** Hue shift preserve-luminance bool (K-136): on = constant-luminance, off = plain-RGB spin.
- [x] **FX-8** Temperature widened (K-135): slider ±150 / hard ±200, per-unit gain 0.5→0.75.
- [x] **FX-9** RGB split: per-channel R/G/B amount scales + a **Samples** control on the
  wavelength/spectral mode (defaults reproduce the classic split). (K-143)
- [x] **FX-10** Chromatic aberration (K-144): three tinted taps via the P2 channel picker
  (default r/g/b) + RGB-split's Wavelength/Samples spectral machinery.
- [x] **FX-11** Shake reworked (K-146): per-axis x/y/z amp+freq in a twirl sub-section (z
  replaces zoom pump); auto-scale removed, replaced with Edges (Transparent/Repeat/Mirror).
  Built the reusable **P3** `EdgesMode` enum + **P4** twirl `ParamGroup` (K-145) for other effects.
- [x] **FX-12** Block glitch: Seed should always be the second-last property, before Mix.
  — done: Seed moved to second-last in the schema (read by id, so resolve/GPU unaffected).
- [x] **FX-13** (K-147) Scanlines collapsed to a single Intensity; old darkness folded in on load.
- [x] **FX-14** (K-148) Datamosh: intensity cap lifted (>1 extrapolates), new **Streak length**
  (frames) scales the flow reach for heavier smear. No rename (per owner). NOTE: streak is
  reach-based, not a fixed I-frame-interval reset (clean frames still fall at stills/cuts); a
  strict interval was deferred. Default streak 4 makes existing instances look stronger.
- [ ] **FX-15** Flash feels off; blocked on audio fixes before it can be tested.
- [x] **FX-16** Glow (K-135): default threshold 0.8, knee label → Softness, radius px 0..inf.
- [x] **FX-17** (K-149) Echo defaults to Screen, gains the standard blend modes, cap raised
  8→16 (bounded for decode cost; higher is a later dynamic-window refinement).
- [x] **FX-18** (K-139) Renamed **Motion blur**; added **Force on all layers** (forces per-layer
  transform MB on every layer during the sample renders, comp unmutated). Note: it blurs
  transform-animated motion; footage-playback motion is held by design (adjustment-scope), which
  is why it read as "nothing" on a footage-only test.
- [x] **FX-19** (K-140) Renamed **Fast motion blur**; blocky seams fixed by scaling each streak
  by a smooth forward/backward-consistency confidence (no hard gate); added a **View** enum
  (Rendered / Motion vectors / Confidence).
- [x] **FX-20** (K-150) New layers centre their anchor on their own content (footage=natural
  size, solid=solid size, precomp/sequence/adjustment=comp) with position at comp centre. Text
  kept at 0,0 (size unknown until glyph layout; AE point-text convention).
- [ ] **FX-21** Matte effect: extra controls per Screenshot_136 (Keylight-style keyer —
  screen colour/gain/balance, despill, screen matte clip/rollback/shrink/softness/despot,
  inside/outside masks, fg/edge colour correction, source crops). Scope TBD with owner.
- [ ] **FX-DoF** (deferred by owner until the rest are sorted) — fuller DoF look.

## Additions / general bugs

- [x] **GEN-1** (K-151) Subtract added at every site (Darken already existed): linear-light
  `max(dst-src,0)`, premultiplied snapshot path.
- [x] **GEN-2** (K-152) Vibrancy effect added (Colour): lifts low-saturation pixels more than
  vivid ones; one Amount dial, 0 = identity.
- [x] **GEN-3** (K-153) Layers now sit freely across comp bounds (start < 0, end > comp end);
  render/audio intersect with [0, comp_end); long imports keep full media duration. LIMIT: the
  timeline doesn't yet pan to negative time, so a pre-0 overhang draws clipped under the lane's
  left edge (flagged for a later view-model change).
- [x] **GEN-4** Audio fixed (K-141): the comp mix now re-derives from the document each
  frame, so mute, move, trim (active span) and delete all take effect live. Caveat: editing
  one of several audio layers mid-playback has a brief re-decode snap; all-silent is instant.
  Unblocks FX-15.
- [x] **GEN-5** Default the lane-timeline grid to **time**, not beats. — done.

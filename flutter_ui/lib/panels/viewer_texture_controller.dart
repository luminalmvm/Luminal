// The Viewer's zero-copy texture lifecycle (K-177).
//
// In plain terms: on Windows the engine can draw the Viewer's picture straight
// into a piece of GPU memory that Flutter shows without any copy. The engine
// hands us an OS "handle" naming that memory; this object registers that handle
// with the Windows runner (over a small platform channel the runner implements),
// gets back a `textureId` the `Texture` widget shows, and tells the runner each
// time a new frame has been drawn. It re-registers when the handle or size
// changes (a comp resize), and — crucially — degrades quietly: if the runner
// does not implement the channel (an old build, or the C++ was not wired), it
// marks itself unavailable so the Viewer falls back to the read-back path. No
// pixels ever pass through this object.
//
// The platform-channel shape (method names, the shared-handle surface type, the
// register/frame-available dance) follows the MIT-licensed `flutter_wgpu_texture`
// package as a reference for the embedder plumbing — we borrow the pattern, not
// the code.
